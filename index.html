                <div class="info">
                    <p>The tale of Icarus is probably one of the most famous stories in Greek mythology, but it is unfortunately one of tragedy. The story actually begins far before the birth of Icarus. His father, Daedalus, was a very famous Athenian inventor, craftsman, and sculptor, and was considered a genius in his time. But, he was egotistical and full of jealousy, so much so that he killed his own nephew and was banished from Athens to Crete. Even with his soiled reputation, Crete’s king Minos opened him with welcome arms, even making him an advisor. He also fell in love with a slave named Naucrate, and Icarus was born.</p>

                    <p>However, his friendship with the king ended when he helped Minos’ wife Pasiphae, who was cursed by Poseidon after her husband broke a promise with the God, to seduce a bull, to which she then gave birth to the infamous Minotaur. As punishment, Minos made Daedalus construct an inescapable Labyrinth to keep the Minotaur in. After its completion, Minos locked both Daedalus and Icarus at the top of the tallest tower on the island where the Labyrinth was. But being the genius inventor that he was, Daedalus made an escape plan. Inspired by the birds that flew around the tower outside, he constructed wings for both himself and his son using metal feathers held to a leather frame with beeswax.</p>

                <div class="info">
                    <p>Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sea as the wings would become too damp and heavy to use. But he also warned him not to fly too close to the sun as the wax that held the wings together would surely melt. But Icarus forgot his father’s warning, flying too close to the sun. Daedalus couldn’t do anything but watch as his son fell into the sea and drowned.
                    There are also alternate reasons as to why Icarus’ wings burned. One ending suggests that Icarus had wings larger than Helios, the sun god. Jealous of that fact, the god struck Icarus with sun rays, melting the beeswax. Another was that of forbidden love. Icarus was in love with Apollo, and by getting too close to his lover, the wings melted.</p>
